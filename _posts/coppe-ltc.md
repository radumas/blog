After finishing my double Masters' in [Transportation](http://cee.mit.edu/graduate/mst) and [City Planning](http://dusp.mit.edu/degrees/masters) at MIT in 2015, I got [MISTI](http://misti.mit.edu/student-programs/location/brazil) funding to go to Rio for a research internship. I'm working at UFRJ, the federal university of Rio de Janeiro located on Ilha do Fundao, an island near the international airport. I'm working for the [LTC](http://www.ltc.coppe.ufrj.br/), the Cargo Transport Lab, on a project to reduce GHG emissions from people commuting to the island. This blog will contain some of the work I've done here, including maps, presentations, and instructions on how to set up and use the open-source tools that I use.
