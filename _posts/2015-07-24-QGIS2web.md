My first leaflet map using the [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) QGIS plugin. It is surprisingly easy to use to make nice Leaflet maps. Though unfortunately my custom rio metro .svg icons [could not display](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/95).

## Exploring census data for Rio de Janeiro.  
I made the map below using the following steps:  
1. I made 1km buffers around every active BRT, Commuter Rail, Gondola, and Metro station.  
2. I intersected these buffers with census geometries, calculating the area of each polygon before and after the intersection.  
3. I summed up the columns for literate persons from age 18 to 65 in postgresql to get the total working age population for each polygon.  
4. In order to get an "average age" I multiplied each age column from 1 to 100 by the number of people in that age column. The following sed command was useful `sed -r 's_([0-9]+)_\1 * & \+_' <age_columns.txt >age_multiply.txt` to repeat the number of the column (the age) after a multiplication symbol.  
5. I then summed these two variables and unioned the shapes with:  

{% highlight sql %}  
SELECT a.id, a.nome, a.tipo_de_si,  
    SUM( x_area/original_area *working_age_pop),  
	ST_Union(a.geom) as geom  
    INTO rio_stations_stats  
FROM alfab_rio_stations_1000 a  
    group by a.id, a.nome, a.tipo_de_si;  
{% endhighlight %}  

Finally:  
6. I colour-coded each line according to their official colours.  
7. And then used the plugin to create the map below, exporting the map to its own folder.
8. The map displayed when testing jekyll locally, but the data wouldn't load on gh-pages, so I had to do a small bit of editing. I had to move the contents of the `data/` folder to the root folder of the map (where the map's `index.html` is located). And then edit the source paths in `index.html` to remove "data"  
![screenshot1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2015-07-24/map_change.png)  
9. I then embedded the map into this post using an iframe  

{% highlight html %}  
    <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/maps/transit_working_age/index.html" height="600" width="900" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&nbsp; </iframe>
{% endhighlight %}  
 

<!--
<div class = "leaflet-map">
    <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/maps/transit_working_age/index.html" height="675" width="900" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&nbsp; </iframe>
</div>
-->

## Thoughts
The metro serves the denser areas (obviously), though the favela of Complexo Alemao, served by the gondola, is very high density.
The difference in average age was rather remarkable. With much older average ages in the core and substantially younger ones in the periphery.

## Wishes  

### QGIS2web plugin
It would be nice if the plugin:  
1. Could let you edit the variable names in the popups.  
2. Didn't display the basemap radio button.  
3. Respected layer order. If you turn a layer off and then on, it automatically displays on top. 

### Things to play with 
Some further things I would like to work on with this map:  
1. Displaying the legend in two columns  
2. Disabling scroll zoom [without clicking on the map](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/111887/leaflet-mouse-wheel-zoom-only-after-click-on-map)  
3. Restricting zoom levels  
4. I want to figure out how to display a table of the data as well, and then maybe do some linking and brushing to highlight, for example, the stations with the oldest average population.  
5. You'll notice the iframe isn't responsive: it has a fixed width even if you change the size of the window (or view this on a phone). I'm still trying to figure out how to solve that [issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31660273/markdown-jekyll-insert-an-iframe-that-fills-the-container).
