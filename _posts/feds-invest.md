Let me begin this post by saying that I believe we need a lot more funding for sustainable transportation if we have any chance of combating climate change, reducing traffic fatalities and environmental hazards, and creating more livable cities. So I should be happy about the Canadian Federal Government pledging [$X.YB ]() dollars into infrastructure for the GTHA (as well as other parts of Canada). And while I am happy that these projects are getting funding, I am skeptical that I think overall this is Bad Policy.

To start off, let me explain a little bit my ideal vision of Federalism. There are distinct levels of government that each has unique powers of revenue generation (the large ones being in order of property tax, income tax, and corporate tax) and consequently somewhat distinct areas of interest. Now I'm not saying the federal government shouldn't be collecting income or sales tax, but it would be weird if they were involved, in such a massive country, in collecting property taxes. I believe, wherever possible, in the devolution of power and granting local control over local money. What I think (roughly) roles for the federal government should be:

 1. Support equal rights for citizens by rebalancing funding to poorer provinces
 2. Collecting and redistributing revenue that might otherwise escape through leakages
 3. Setting and funding national priorities that might be unaddressed by lower governments
 4. Funding programs that support the national economy: defense, international airports, international maritime ports...
 
The major major example of federal infrastructure I will give is the Interstate Highway System in America. This was a national priority to boost the economy, funded by a gas tax into a dedicated trust fund. But the interesting quirk was that it did not provide 100% funding, it instead matched State spending 90:10. This was tremendously effective at getting states to plan and execute projects to connect America, but has a darker element to it. It often eroded local control (see every Black and minority neighbourhood bulldozed or cut off by highways). By wielding the threat of losing this free money, proper public consultation and participatory planning was often overruled, to the detriment of many many communities, and eventually bridges to nowhere. Nor did anyone budget for maintenance, which can leave States and local governments struggling to pay to maintain infrastructure that they could never afford. 

## Why I think this is bad policy

While I am thrilled that the Liberals are drawing attention to the State of Good Repair, as my instructor at MIT, the honorable Fred Salvucci, once said "it's not a question of State of Good Repair or New Infrastructure. It should be both. We need new sustainable transportation infrastructure to have sustainable growth **while** maintaining what we already have". There's certainly a missed opportunity for not having Most Handsome Dad chiding local governments for having "let it come to this". Here's a further list of what I don't like about this injection of cash:
 
 1. It's incentivizing bad behaviour by encouraging municipal and provincial governments to continue deferring maintenance so that the federal government will swoop in and save the day.
 2. Either it's opening up the Federal Liberals to interregional political blowback (why are income taxes in Saskatchewan funding) which could erode the political and trust in the government to actually do something about funding ambitious sustainable transportation plans.
 3. Or it's a form of pork-barrel politics, which means everyone (or most liberal districts) are getting a little infrastructure funding that is magically coming from somewhere. This leads to Bridges to Nowhere (tm)
 4. While I don't disagree that these are projects that needed funding from somewhere (they aren't "sexy" but they're needed), funding for State of Good Repair isn't an Investment, it's the money you should have been spending all this time on maintenance to properly benefit from the billions you've already invested. Money for repairs isn't improving the economy, it's just avoiding an impending disaster, and thus shouldn't be financed with debt if at all possible (you're not going to be richer from doing it). 
 5. This is just kicking the can down the road for creating the necessary institutions to provide dedicated funding for transportation infrastructure construction **and maintenance**
 
The analogy I'll use is that you co-finance a car with your parents so you can drive to your first job. This is an investment, it enables you to reap the benefits of accessing the job market. Your parents periodically tell you that it's your responsibility to regularly maintain the car but... well that money could be better spent on beer. Finally your engine (or some other expensive part) gives out and you have a problem because you won't be able to go to work. But, no worries! Your parents will just buy you a new car. See anything problematic in this story?

Should mayors and premiers give the federal money back a la Chris Christie's TransHudson tunnels in New Jersey? Definitely not. I do think we should continue pressuring local and provincial governments to put their money where their promises of sustainability are and dedicate dollars for transportation infrastructure construction **and maintenance**.
