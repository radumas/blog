After finishing my double Masters' in [Transportation](http://cee.mit.edu/graduate/mst) and [City Planning](http://dusp.mit.edu/degrees/masters) at MIT in 2015, I got [MISTI](http://misti.mit.edu/student-programs/location/brazil) funding to go to Rio for a research internship. I worked for the [LTC](http://www.ltc.coppe.ufrj.br/), the Cargo Transport Lab at UFRJ, the federal university of Rio de Janeiro located on Ilha do Fundao, an island near the international airport. My project aimed to reduce GHG emissions from people commuting to the island.
