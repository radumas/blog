A collection of posts about my work at the [Boston Cyclists Union](http://bostoncyclistsunion.org/) an advocacy organization in Greater Boston fighting for better infrastructure and rights to serve cyclists of all ages. I did data and GIS work for them, building an [online crowdsourcing map](https://github.com/radumas/bikeways4everyone) that enables users to draw in routes and drop markers where they would like better infrastructure.
