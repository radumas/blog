I wanted to transition away from R to Python for data analysis stuff so I'm taking a [Data Analysis specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis), amongst others. This is a collection of posts for that class, and others, and includes setup instructions for Ubuntu.
